This script assumes that you have a Part named ThunderGlove in your game that will serve as the "Thunder Glove" object. The script listens to the Activated event on the ThunderGlove object, which you would trigger when the player hits another player with the glove. When that happens, the script will loop through all players in the game and check if they are within the explosion radius. If they are, it will temporarily put their character into ragdoll mode by turning off the PlatformStand property and adding a force to their Humanoid object. After the ragdoll duration has passed, the script will turn PlatformStand back on and restore the player's JumpPower.
